# Motivation

1. For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.

The dataset was created to forecast election voting behavior and understand voting behavior of individuals. The task is to predict election results based on surveyed data. Election predictions in the past have often been criticized, so our analysis works to improve forecasts. 

2. Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?

The Data Analytics team at Hu Private Company.


3. Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.

No direct funding was received for this project.

4. Any other comments?

No.


# Composition

1. What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.

Each row of the main dataset is an individual of Hu Private Company. The row contains variables such as age group, gender, education level, race, political party affiliation, and candidate voted for. 

2. How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?

400 rows with 6 columns of variables.

3. Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).

The dataset is a sample. It is a sample of employees at a private company. The sample is representative of the company population, but we are using this sample to cover the population of the country. In order to do this, we will use MRP.

4. What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.

Each instance consists of information such as age, race, education, or political party, so these variables are all positive integers.

5. Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.

No, there is no unique key. 

6. Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.

All relevant information for this study is included in the data. No missing information for individual instances.

7. Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users’ movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.

Yes, each row represents the unique information of that individual. 

8. Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.

No.


9. Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.

No.

10. Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.

Self-contained.

11. Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.

No, all data were gathered from individuals of the company with consent.

12. Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.

No.

13. Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.

Yes, each individual belongs to an age group, racial group, gender, political party, etc. 

14. Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.

No, not possible to identify individuals. 

15. Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.

Yes, there is data on race and political opinions.

16. Any other comments?

No.


# Collection process

1. How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.

The data was reported by subjects through survey responses. The data was not validated officially and self-reported by the subjects. 

2. What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (for example, hardware apparatuses or sensors, manual human curation, software programs, software APIs)? How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?

Loading into R. All data was provided in the form of a csv file.

3. If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (for example, deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?

The dataset contains randomly sampled data from the company. Every employee at the contact had equal probability of being selected to be surveyed. 

4. Who was involved in the data collection process (for example, students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they compensated (for example, how much were crowdworkers paid)?

Company employees. Company employees that agreed to be surveyed received a $5 Tim Hortons gift card.

5. Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the instances (for example, recent crawl of old news articles)? If not, please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with the instances was created.

Data was collected over the period of one month. The survey was available for one month, and employees could choose whether or not to participate. 

6. Were any ethical review processes conducted (for example, by an institutional review board)? If so, please provide a description of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.

No.

7. Did you collect the data from the individuals in question directly, or obtain it via third parties or other sources (for example, websites)?

Data was collected from the individuals in question directly.

8. Were the individuals in question notified about the data collection? If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how notice was provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language of the notification itself.

Yes. The data collection was through a survey that participants consented to participating in. 

9. Did the individuals in question consent to the collection and use of their data? If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how consent was requested and provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language to which the individuals consented.

Yes. Participants knew that their survey reponses were to be collected and used for analysis. 

10. If consent was obtained, were the consenting individuals provided with a mechanism to revoke their consent in the future or for certain uses? If so, please provide a description, as well as a link or other access point to the mechanism (if appropriate).

Yes, if participants changed their mind about their survey results being used, they could contact the data researches at any time before a given date to withdraw their information. 

11. Has an analysis of the potential impact of the dataset and its use on data subjects (for example, a data protection impact analysis) been conducted? If so, please provide a description of this analysis, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.

No.
